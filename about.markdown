Nice of you to stop by :). I am a PhD student in electrical engineering in Aachen/JÃ¼lich. My focus of work is in bio-inspired algorithms for efficient machine learning. To this end, I am currently learning a lot about both machine learning and computational neuroscience. And I thought I might as well take anyone with me on that journey, who is willing to read my sorrow explanations while I try to grasp these concepts myself.
