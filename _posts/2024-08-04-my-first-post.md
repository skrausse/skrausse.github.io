# The first notebook is here

I can write some text here and see how it goes. This should be easy.


```python
# Let's also write some code.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.arange(0, 20, 0.1)
y = np.cos(x)

# Plot some results to see how output is handled.

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('cos(x)')
plt.show()
```
