# Cognitive maps

Have you ever wondered, when exactly you learn something? What exactly triggers the process of learning in the brain?

A typical answer to this would be reinforcing events. When you get a positive reward, you tend to repeat the thing that led to this reward. When you received a punishment, maybe not do the same thing the next time you are in this situation. 

However, the idea of learning through reinforcement comes with several practical issues. For example, if we were to only learn through reinforcement, we would have to obtain any reward or punishment in order to avoid them in the future. But some mistakes, we would rather not even make once! I for one do not want to learn that stovetops are hot by first having to burn my hand on one.

Another issue with the idea of soley learning through reinforcement is the so-called credit assignment problem: Sometimes, it is hard to find the cause that led to the reward or punishment. Did studying the last few days have more of an impact on my good grade than the fact that I took the bicycle to the exam instead of the bus? Which of the two behaviours should be inforced for the next exam?

## The discovery of the cognitive map

In 1948, neuroscientists had exactly those discussions when trying to understand how the brain learns. Do we really just wait for a reward to come by and then reinforce our recent behavior? Edward Tolman, an experimental neuroscientists working with rats at the time, found himself in the middle of a lot of these discussions. So he, together with his colleagues, started to design experiments that tested how rats learn [1]. They decided to test the animals by having them solve a maze: A rat would be placed at one side of the maze and had to forage around until it found some reward - Then the rat is picked up out of the maze and put back in its home cage. The researchers repeated this experiment every day. 

Unsurprisingly, the rats got better and better at finding the direct path to the reward location. But was this due to reward based learning, or some more suffisticated method? Did the animal actually learn a map of the maze to navigate in, or did it just remember all the left / right turns in order to get to the reward? To test this, the researchers also tested a second group of rats. These rats were put into the same maze, but when they arrived at the reward position, they did not get any reward, but instead were just picked up and put back into the home cage. Again, unsurprisingly, these rats were not so eager to directly run to the 'reward' location and spent more time exploring the environment. Then, one lucky day, this second group of rats also became a reward at the reward location. 

Astonishingly, the day after that, the rats in the second group were just as good at directly running to the reward location as the rats in the first group, that had been getting a reward for multiple days at this point. Apparently, the group two rats did learn the layout of the maze during their random explorations of it. The rats had built what Tolman called a 'cognitive map' - a mental representation of space that existed independent of any reward. And they could employ this map as soon as they had a potential reward they wanted to get to!

<!-- ## Multiple objects in the world
- Tolman shows experiment where there is food and water in the maze. The animals find the rewards, but can never have them
- Then one group of hungry and another group of thirsty rats are put into the maze. Both groups directly move to the correct rewards - The thirsty ones run to the water, the hungry ones run to the food.
- Let's take a moment to unpack why this is so amazing
- No reward during the learning of the cognitive map - It is intrinsicly learned during exploration. We just can't help but learn what is around us
- Multiple objects in the map and we can query the position of the correct one: The map must be of the form object -> location
- This leads us to the concept pattern completion (Hopfield networks) -->
