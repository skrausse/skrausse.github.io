Hi, I am Sven. Nice of you to stop by :). I am a PhD student in electrical engineering in Aachen/JÃ¼lich. My focus of work is in bio-inspired algorithms for efficient machine learning. To this end, I am currently learning a lot about both machine learning and computational neuroscience. And I thought I might as well take anyone with me on that journey, who is willing to read my sorrow explanations while I try to grasp these concepts myself. 

This webpage will someday be my blog of random learning journeys. For now its empty. But I plan to make some deepdives into topics that are interesting to me in the near future. Probably, they are mostly centered around machine learning and computational neuroscience, but it really could be everything from time to time. I am easily distracted ;)
